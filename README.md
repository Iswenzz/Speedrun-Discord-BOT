The Speedrun Discord BOT lets users within the Sr- discord server to see the top 30 ranks and times for a specified map and route. This bot was created for the sole purpose of convienience for the users; Being able to view map times without having to launch the game was an aspect that I wanted to provide for players who want to keep track of world records.
